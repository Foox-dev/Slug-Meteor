# Slug-Meteor
Configured Meteor Client Instances, tailored to my own preferences.

## About

This repository contains pre-configured instances of the [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/), built for use with [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/). The instances are designed to be plug-and-play, allowing you to skip *most* of the configuration.
Instances for differant Minecraft versions are in the other branches. Keep in mind, the mods may differ in other versions.
